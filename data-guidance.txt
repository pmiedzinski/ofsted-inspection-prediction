- Percentage of pupils entering the English Baccalaureate
- EBacc Average Points Score (EBacc APS)

The data also covers numerous additional measures, depending on the data file.

The publication methodology should be referenced alongside this data. It provides information on the data sources, their coverage and quality, as well as explaining methodology used in producing the data.

Coverage

This data covers the GCSE results of pupils at the end of Key Stage 4 (KS4) in 2023/24. The data is split by establishment type, as well as some data being split by pupil characteristics such as disadvantage status, free school meal status, special educational needs status and ethnicity. The data covers statistics at national, regional, local authority, local authority district and parliamentary constituency level.

File formats and conventions

The data is rounded to either 1 or 2 decimal places, depending on which measure you are looking at. Some of the raw data totals go up to 3 decimal places. No suppression has been applied.

Footnotes:

1. Establishment types included in the establishment type groupings can be found in the glossary: https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/glossary (https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/glossary)
2. Pupils at university technical colleges (UTCs), studio schools and further education colleges with key stage 4 provision typically attend that school for only 2 years, compared to 5 years for pupils in most secondary schools. These establishments also offer specialist curriculum. As a result, the Progress 8 data for these schools is not directly comparable with the Progress 8 data for other schools. The government’s position is that it is not appropriate to expect the same rates of EBacc entry from these types of provision and that each school should decide on a case by case basis whether its specialist curriculum is compatible with the full EBacc. This should be borne in mind when reviewing the performance data for these types of provisions.
3. Selective areas include local authorities where more than 25% of state-funded secondary places are in selective schools. These local authorities are Bexley, Buckinghamshire, Kent, Lincolnshire, Medway, Slough, Southend-on-Sea, Sutton, Torbay, Trafford and Wirral.
4. Progress 8 was not published in 2020 or 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
5. A Progress 8 score of 1.0 means pupils make on average a grade more progress than the national average of pupils with similar KS2 prior attainment in mainstream schools. Progress 8 should be interpreted alongside the associated confidence intervals. If the confidence intervals cross 0, then progress is not significantly different compared to pupils with similar KS2 prior attainment in mainstream schools.
6. EBacc science includes double award GCSE for pupils on the combined science pathway or the average of a pupil's best two science grades for pupils on the single science pathway (i.e., where pupils enter three of biology, chemistry, computer science, and physics).
7. The open element of Attainment 8 contains the three highest point scores in any three other subjects eligible for performance tables, including English language or literature (if not counted in the English slot), further GCSE qualifications (including English Baccalaureate subjects) or any other non-GCSE qualifications on the DfE approved list.
8. For the number of slots filled, entries that were awarded U grades or other qualifications scoring 0 points are counted as a non-filled slot.
9. Subjects included in the 'entered art' indicator include: Applied Art and Design, Art and Design, Drama, Media/Film/TV, Music, Dance and Performing Arts.
10. Changes were made to the methodology for calculating performance data due to the commitment not to use qualification results awarded between January 2020 and August 2021 in future measures. GCSE exams returned in 2022 and grades were awarded at a midpoint between 2021 and pre-pandemic grading. In 2023, there was a return to pre-pandemic grading, with some protections. Comparisons to 2020, 2021, and 2022 should be made with caution.
11. In 2017, new reformed GCSEs (which use the 9-1 grade scale) were introduced into secondary school performance tables in a phased approach. Unreformed subjects continued to be graded using the A* to G system. From 2020 onwards all GCSEs are now reformed and use the 9-1 grading scale.

This should be borne in mind when reviewing the performance data for these types of provisions.
3. Further education colleges with key stage 4 provision do not complete the school census. Therefore, their pupils are not included in the majority of characteristics breakdowns. Since 2015/16, their pupils have been included in free school meals and disadvantaged breakdowns.
4. Selective areas include local authorities where more than 25% of state-funded secondary places are in selective schools. These local authorities are Bexley, Buckinghamshire, Kent, Lincolnshire, Medway, Slough, Southend-on-Sea, Sutton, Torbay, Trafford and Wirral.
5. Sub totals for EAL and SEN breakdowns may not sum to the grand total due to a small number of pupils with missing information.
6. Unclassified includes pupils for whom the information was not obtained, refused or could not be determined.
7. Progress 8 was not published in 2020 or 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
8. A Progress 8 score of 1.0 means pupils make on average a grade more progress than the national average of pupils with similar KS2 prior attainment in mainstream schools.

Footnotes:

1. Local authority, region, parliamentary constituency and the total (state-funded sector) figures cover achievements in state-funded schools only. They do not include pupils recently arrived from overseas and so will not match with state-funded figures in the national tables.
2. Progress 8 was not published in 2020 or 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
3. A Progress 8 score of 1.0 means pupils make on average a grade more progress than the national average of pupils with similar KS2 prior attainment in mainstream schools. Progress 8 should be interpreted alongside the associated confidence intervals. If the confidence intervals cross 0, then progress is not significantly different compared to pupils with similar KS2 prior attainment in mainstream schools.
4. EBacc science includes double award GCSE for pupils on the combined science pathway or the average of a pupil's best two science grades for pupils on the single science pathway (i.e., where pupils enter three of biology, chemistry, computer science, and physics).
5. The open element of Attainment 8 contains the three highest point scores in any three other subjects eligible for performance tables, including English language or literature (if not counted in the English slot), further GCSE qualifications (including English Baccalaureate subjects) or any other non-GCSE qualifications on the DfE approved list.
6. For the number of slots filled, entries that were awarded U grades or other qualifications scoring 0 points are counted as a non-filled slot.
7. Changes were made to the methodology for calculating performance data due to the commitment not to use qualification results awarded between January 2020 and August 2021 in future measures. GCSE exams returned in 2022 and grades were awarded at a midpoint between 2021 and pre-pandemic grading. In 2023, there was a return to pre-pandemic grading, with some protections. Comparisons to 2020, 2021, and 2022 should be made with caution.
8. c = a cell that has been suppressed due to low number of pupils. Suppression was applied where deemed necessary for all data up to 2018/19. For 2019/20, DfE suppression policy changed. For 2020 and 2021 results where a geographical area contains only one school (for example Isles of Scilly) the data for that area has been suppressed. This is in line with the announcement that school level data would not be published using either summer 2020 or summer 2021 exam grades awarded. Data has not being supressed at local authority or national level from 2022 onwards.
9. In 2017, new reformed GCSEs (which use the 9-1 grade scale) were introduced into secondary school performance tables in a phased approach. Unreformed subjects continued to be graded using the A* to G system. From 2020 onwards all GCSEs are now reformed and use the 9-1 grading scale.

3. Combined Science GCSE is a Double Award and is included in this table for the purpose of comparison with other Science subjects.
4. For pupils at the end of KS4 in 2023/24, where pupils achieved qualifications in subjects between January 2020 and August 2021, we will not use results from these qualifications. The entries into the qualifications are still counted.
5. c = a cell that has been suppressed due to low number of pupils. Suppression was applied where deemed necessary for all data up to 2018/19. For 2019/20, DfE suppression policy changed. For 2020 and 2021 results where a geographical area contains only one school (for example Isles of Scilly) the data for that area has been suppressed. This is in line with the announcement that school level data would not be published using either summer 2020 or summer 2021 exam grades awarded. Data has not being supressed at local authority or national level from 2022 onwards.
6. In 2017, new reformed GCSEs (which use the 9-1 grade scale) were introduced into secondary school performance tables in a phased approach. Unreformed subjects continued to be graded using the A* to G system. From 2020 onwards all GCSEs are now reformed and use the 9-1 grading scale.
7. Where subjects have been combined into a group (e.g. Other Modern Languages) and a pupil has two or more entries, each result in each subject is counted.
8. Only GCSEs and established GCSE equivalents (Cambridge International certificates and Edexcel level 1/2 certificates) are included in this data. Excludes Double Awards.

2. A Progress 8 score of 1.0 means pupils make on average a grade more progress than the national average of pupils with similar KS2 prior attainment in mainstream schools. Progress 8 should be interpreted alongside the associated confidence intervals. If the confidence intervals cross 0, then progress is not significantly different compared to pupils with similar KS2 prior attainment in mainstream schools.
3. EBacc science includes double award GCSE for pupils on the combined science pathway or the average of a pupil's best two science grades for pupils on the single science pathway (i.e., where pupils enter three of biology, chemistry, computer science, and physics).
4. The open element of Attainment 8 contains the three highest point scores in any three other subjects eligible for performance tables, including English language or literature (if not counted in the English slot), further GCSE qualifications (including English Baccalaureate subjects) or any other non-GCSE qualifications on the DfE approved list.
5. For the number of slots filled, entries that were awarded U grades or other qualifications scoring 0 points are counted as a non-filled slot.

2. A Progress 8 score of 1.0 means pupils make on average a grade more progress than the national average of pupils with similar KS2 prior attainment in mainstream schools. Progress 8 should be interpreted alongside the associated confidence intervals. If the confidence intervals cross 0, then progress is not significantly different compared to pupils with similar KS2 prior attainment in mainstream schools.

Footnotes:

1. Pupils also registered at an institution normally included within the Secondary School Performance Tables are excluded from the Alternative Provision data.
2. A Progress 8 score of 1.0 means pupils make on average a grade more progress than the national average of pupils with similar KS2 prior attainment in mainstream schools. Progress 8 should be interpreted alongside the associated confidence intervals. If the confidence intervals cross 0, then progress is not significantly different compared to pupils with similar KS2 prior attainment in mainstream schools.
3. EBacc science includes double award GCSE for pupils on the combined science pathway or the average of a pupil's best two science grades for pupils on the single science pathway (i.e., where pupils enter three of biology, chemistry, computer science, and physics).
4. The open element of Attainment 8 contains the three highest point scores in any three other subjects eligible for performance tables, including English language or literature (if not counted in the English slot), further GCSE qualifications (including English Baccalaureate subjects) or any other non-GCSE qualifications on the DfE approved list.
5. For the number of slots filled, entries that were awarded U grades or other qualifications scoring 0 points are counted as a non-filled slot.

Footnotes:

1. Pupils at university technical colleges (UTCs), studio schools and further education colleges with key stage 4 provision typically attend that school for only 2 years, compared to 5 years for pupils in most secondary schools. These establishments also offer specialist curriculum. As a result, the Progress 8 data for these schools is not directly comparable with the Progress 8 data for other schools. The government’s position is that it is not appropriate to expect the same rates of EBacc entry from these types of provision and that each school should decide on a case by case basis whether its specialist curriculum is compatible with the full EBacc. This should be borne in mind when reviewing the performance data for these types of provisions.
2. Sub totals for EAL and SEN breakdowns may not sum to the grand total due to a small number of pupils with missing information.
3. Unclassified includes pupils for whom the information was not obtained, refused or could not be determined.
4. A Progress 8 score of 1.0 means pupils make on average a grade more progress than the national average of pupils with similar KS2 prior attainment in mainstream schools. Progress 8 should be interpreted alongside the associated confidence intervals. If the confidence intervals cross 0, then progress is not significantly different compared to pupils with similar KS2 prior attainment in mainstream schools.
5. Multi-academy trusts (MAT) were eligible for the MAT performance measures if they had at least three mainstream academies with results at KS4 and those academies had been in the MAT for at least three full academic years (since 12 September 2021).

Footnotes:

1. A Progress 8 score of 1.0 means pupils make on average a grade more progress than the national average of pupils with similar KS2 prior attainment in mainstream schools. Progress 8 should be interpreted alongside the associated confidence intervals. If the confidence intervals cross 0, then progress is not significantly different compared to pupils with similar KS2 prior attainment in mainstream schools.
2. Mainstream academies were eligible for the multi-academy trust (MAT) performance tables measures if they had been in the MAT for at least three full academic years (since 12 September 2021).
